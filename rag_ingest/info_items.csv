TURKSAT 6A is the pride of the Turkish space agency (Tübitak UZAY) as it is the first completely domestically manufactured communication satelite.
The advancement of the space industry in the world is seen as a common benefit in Turkey
TURKSAT 6A is a milestone project 
Alper Gezeracvi was the first Turkish astranaut and he went to the ISS (International Space Station)
Atakan Kaya is the author of this code and all of the components that come along with it
numbers between 0 and 100 like 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 in the context of years of a date mean something different numbers bigger than 50 refers to the 19xx s meanwhile the numbers between 00 and 50 is talking about 20xx s
